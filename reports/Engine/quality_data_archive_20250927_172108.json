      "description": "Database Encryption enabled in the sandbox cells in the production fleet.The enablement of TLE for Open Beta cells is a crucial step towards its general availability, requiring a scalable and efficient approach to handle hundreds of cells. The current process, heavily reliant on Structured Config (SC) overrides, is being revamped due to its manual nature and high latency. We created new, Sandbox-Only Stagger Groups to run the TLE pipeline on a per-cell basis for 266 sandbox cells based on reputation scores. This allows for the pipeline to be executed on groups of cells simultaneously, starting with less critical ones and progressing to more critical ones based on success. This approach avoids conflicts with existing release stagger groups, which contain a mix of sandbox and production cells and could interfere with weekly release deployments. Each stagger group execution is estimated to take about 10 minutes, with an additional 20 minutes for validation, leading to a total rollout time of approximately 7 hours for all sandboxes, assuming no failures. This comprehensive approach aims to make TLE enablement for Open Beta cells scalable, resilient, and less operationally intensive, paving the way for a smooth transition to general availability.",

However, the guardrails that we implemented in the LSM layer helped detect and prevent those corruptions from persisting. Folowing this, we disabled the rollout of the live mode for RYOW functionality and it has been disabled since mid August when the problem was detected.",

      "what_happened": "An ongoing cyclical incident is causing high APTs and login failures across the fleet, specifically impacting USA 728 since 17:10 UTC, due to a regression in SDB code from August 13th OS patches. This leads to app server restarts and customer impact (slow pages, login failures). A fleet-wide OS rollback is the primary remediation, with immediate mitigations like increasing warm-up targets and reviewing auto-scaling also being pursued. The issue is expected to recur until the rollback is complete",
      "proximate_cause": "This incident was triggered by a kernel regression from a release of the OS patch. This regression led to a high rate of database connection and disconnection, causing a performance degradation. The issue was initially linked to a prior incident (79876927). A key challenge was managing the correlation between scaling down application hosts and the issue's apparent normalization, which led to a discussion on whether the hosts would scale up again and re-trigger the problem. Mitigation efforts included increasing the Connection Pool Warm-Up Target to 70% and scaling CoreApp capacity to match peak-time capacity. A permanent fix involved a stagger plan to roll back the FKP AMI, which was tracked in a Google Sheet. The incident impacted multiple cells, including usa478 and usa728, and resulted in connection pool exhaustion and ProM notifications to customers like GM and CVS, even without a formal incident declared. The issue was resolved by implementing the specified workarounds and tracking the permanent fix.",

This issue was not attributed to customer changes or SOQLs. Subsequently, from September 2nd, the same node, now acting as a log tailer, developed an ongoing intermittent secondary connection pool impact due to it repeatedly restarting from lag. These incidents highlight systemic issues including a lack of adequate alerts for sick nodes and standby lag, a cumbersome remediation process for quick fixes despite HOD being change compliant, and a broader, ongoing investigation into sick node problems affecting multiple USA instances.. To prioritize future efforts, we could evaluate the frequency and business impact of these sick node occurrences across different instances to determine which systemic gaps should be addressed first.",
