Challenges   Faced during last week -
Post deployment of 258.15.7 Archival ERR, all archival worker pods in crashloopbackoff state due to mismatch of versioning between archival, cloudstore and store
In Impacted cluster ,  cloudstore/ store are on lower version and Archival are on higher version. To Resolve, rolled back archival version to 258.11.8 on all affected clusters
Intermittently Macha Services's Error impacting Releases Executed in MR . It failed to trigger few Deployments. So, manually recreate the execution of failed Pods. 
Need to clean up the 13K old open cases for restore is causing MR performance issues and slowing down SDB rollout.
