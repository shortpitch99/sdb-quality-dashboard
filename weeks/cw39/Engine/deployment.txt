Challenges   Faced during last week -
MR Safe Change Compliance checks for Tier 0 services were enabled on 9/24 UTC (I believe noone was aware ahead of time) and we were not ready to comply to all checks, as such unable to trigger SDB deployments from MR, it was resolved on 9/26 UTC after requesting exemption from MR team.
