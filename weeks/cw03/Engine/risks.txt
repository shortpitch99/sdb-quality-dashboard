Feature: Read your own writes(RYOW)
Status: Yellow
Priority: Medium
Description: Performance enhancement feature for Write Scaling. TLE dark launch mode has been rolled out to multiple cells. However, when rolling out the live mode, we ran into an issue on a couple of cells including the UHG sandbox cell (USA804s) where it seems to run into a possible data corruption issue. However, the guardrails that we implemented in the LSM layer helped detect and prevent those corruptions from persisting. Folowing this, we disabled the rollout of the live mode for RYOW functionality and it has been disabled since mid August when the problem was detected.
